Final Project for MPCS 51042 (Fishing Game)

Project Overview (Fishing Game - from Proposal)

I have always liked basic desktop games and applications, like Minesweeper or Solitaire. My first idea for a project would be to create a fun game that can be packaged into an executable program using tkinter or another basic UI toolkit. I have an idea for a fishing game where the player can: 
Catch fish, with some species being more common and more rare
Have logic to determine the “grade” of the fish once caught
Sell fish and buy fishing equipment in a shop. 
Change locations in order to have a different fishing experience and catch different types of fish. 
Track their achievements in the game application. 
Player information is saved across different runs of the game. 

Once I have all the python figured out, I’d like to turn the game into an executable and downloadable program.
