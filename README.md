Final Project for MPCS 51042 (Fishing Game)

Project Overview (Fishing Game - from Proposal)

I have always liked basic desktop games and applications, like Minesweeper or Solitaire. My first idea for a project would be to create a fun game that can be packaged into an executable program using tkinter or another basic UI toolkit. I have an idea for a fishing game where the player can: 
 - Catch fish, with some species being more common and more rare
 - Have logic to determine the “grade” of the fish once caught
 - Sell fish and buy fishing equipment in a shop. 
 - Change locations in order to have a different fishing experience and catch different types of fish. 
 - Track their achievements in the game application. 
 - Player information is saved across different runs of the game. 

- Convert the game into an executable and downloadable program.

TO DO LIST: 

 - Week 4: Create the baseline structure for the game, including a tkinter executable window that allows the player to run the program and catch fish into their inventory. Save player information into pickle files.  
 - Week 5: Include fish grading logic; build basic shop workflow. Allow players to buy certain fishing equipment and certain fish. 
 - Week 6: Add experience and currency to track how well the player is doing. Track the player's current skill at fishing using the experience and check their currency. Make sure currency works with shop. Add currency values to fish based on species and grade. 
 - Week 7: Add locations and new fish species to allow for gameplay variety. Add logic to when fish are "available" (certain times of day, months). Allow players to unlock location through shop. 
 - Week 8: Add achievements to the game. Allow the player to check their achievements and requirements for achievements that have not been completed yet.  
 - Week 9: Convert the game into an executable and downloadable program.
