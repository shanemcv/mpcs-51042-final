Welcome to Fishtown! You may be a little confused about how things work here, so I'm here to help!

Note: feel free to scroll down to view all of the help we have to offer!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The first thing you need to know is how to get around, and where you might want to go! Back on the main menu, you have a bunch of options for where to go next: 
(1) Go Fishing
(2) Shop
(3) Encyclopedia
(4) Locations
(5) Gear
(6) Achievements
(7) Help - you already made it here!
(8) Quit

I'll break down what happens in each of these windows in some more detail. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) Go Fishing. Here, you can go fishing. You can check your current location in the bottom left, which will tell you where you're currently fishing. You can
click the "Catch Fish" button or (pro tip) press "F" to go fishing. This will open the fishing minigame, where you can click (or again, press "F"), when the slider
is in the right spot, and you'll catch a fish! You'll notice the fish lands in your inventory with some stars next to it. 

This is a good place to tell you a little more about how the fish work. There are some fish species that are unique to each location you might go fishing in. In your starting
location (Local Pond), there are 10 fish species that you can catch. Each fish species has a "rarity", which tells you how rare it is to catch that kind of fish. Rarity levels go from

(a) bronze
(b) silver
(c) gold
(d) platinum
(e) diamond

with diamond being the rarest. Your fish will be color-coded in your inventory depending on how rare they are. 

Beyond species rarity, there's also the individual grade that each of your caught fish receives (these are the ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê that you see next to your fish). Grades are based on the following:

(1) length - vs average length of that species
(2) weight - vs average weight of that species
(3) colouration - how vividly colored the fish is
(4) condition - how healthy the fish is

Grades are on a 5 star scale, but if your fish excels in ALL of the above categories, you can catch the elusive 6 star fish! (‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê).

There are some fun grades on the lower end, if the fish you catch ends up being rotten too (ü§¢). 

You'll be paid more for higher quality fish, so when you catch a nice one, it's a big deal!

There is a textbox at the bottom of this page that will show you detailed information about the fish you've caught, as well as other messages about leveling up or unlocking achievements. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(2) Shop. Here, you can sell your fish and buy fishing equipment. Choose a fish from your inventory to sell, or sell all of your fish. 

You can also buy new fishing rods, which are always in stock at the store. Fishing rods help make it a little easier to catch fish (i.e. the moving slider gets a little bit slower). 

You earn gold coins for selling your fish, which can buy new fishing rods, or unlock new Locations in the Locations tab. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(3) Encyclopedia. Here, you can view your list of caught fish species. These will show in green when you've caught a fish of that species, or red if you haven't yet. 

You can get a sneak peek of what kind of fish are at the locations you haven't unlocked yet here too!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(4) Locations. Here, you can purchase new unlockable locations, and switch to new locations after you've unlocked them. 

Whenever you load up the game, you'll be fishing at Local Pond. To switch a location, simply navigate here and select a location you've unlocked. 

When you've unlocked a location, you can switch to fishing at that location by clicking the location's button one more time. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(5) Gear. Here, you can view the Gear that your player owns, and switch to a different piece of gear if you want with the Equip Item button. This gear shows the items that you've bought
from the shop. Remember, the fishing rods can slow down how fast the fishing slider moves!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(6) Achievements. Here, you can view your achievements. The achievement will be green if you have achieved it, or red if you have not. 

The descriptions for each achievement tell you what you need to do to unlock that achievement. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(7) Help and (8) Quit.

You're already on the help page, and the quit will leave the game! Don't worry, your data will be saved across player sessions. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a good place to talk about the player level.

Your player level will start at 1 and increase as your gain more experience (XP). You'll notice that the levels slow down the higher your level gets. 

Thanks for visiting the help page! I hope this cleared up some things for you.
